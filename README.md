### Sean McKeown's Blog Posts

Over the course of the spring 2024 semester, I had the delight of learning from Proffessor Matt O'Donnell about A.I. and large language models. One of the most creative and testing clases I have ever gotten the pleasure of enjoying.

This repository holds blog posts in which I experimented with what LLM's can handel. Inside is everything from making bombs to learning how barcodes work. I am happy to say this assignment taught me a great deal about LLM's capabilities and my own.

While a tad disorganized, I hope the contents of this repository can bring enjoyment to some!
