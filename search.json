Let me know if you need any more information. * Llama Sure, here is a list of each individual NFL team’s leading rusher and receiver for the 2020 NFL season, based on the official NFL statistics:\nRushers:\n\nArizona Cardinals - Kenyan Drake (1059 yards) and David Johnson (812 yards)\nAtlanta Falcons - Devonta Freeman (833 yards) and Tevin Coleman (725 yards)\nBaltimore Ravens - Mark Ingram (1,018 yards) and Gus Edwards (723 yards)\nBuffalo Bills - Devin Singletary (977 yards) and Frank Gore (721 yards)\nCarolina Panthers - Christian McCaffrey (1,387 yards) and Cameron Artis-Payne (515 yards)\nChicago Bears - David Montgomery (1,059 yards) and Tarik Cohen (444 yards)\nCincinnati Bengals - Joe Mixon (1,137 yards) and Giovani Bernard (432 yards)\nCleveland Browns - Nick Chubb (865 yards) and Kareem Hunt (467 yards)\nDallas Cowboys - Ezekiel Elliott (979 yards) and Tony Pollard (275 yards)\nDenver Broncos - Melvin Gordon (841 yards) and Phillip Lindsay (704 yards)\nDetroit Lions - Kerryon Johnson (842 yards) and Ty Johnson (445 yards)\nGreen Bay Packers - Aaron Jones (1,084 yards) and Jamaal Williams (464 yards)\nHouston Texans - Carlos Hyde (1,070 yards) and Duke Johnson (427 yards)\nIndianapolis Colts - Jonathan Williams (833 yards) and Nyheim Hines (444 yards)\nJacksonville Jaguars - Leonard Fournette (815 yards) and Chris Thompson (367 yards)\nKansas City Chiefs - Darrel Williams (755 yards) and LeSean McCoy (435 yards)\nLos Angeles Chargers - Austin Ekeler (847 yards) and Melvin Gordon (476 yards)\nLos Angeles Rams - Todd Gurley (857 yards) and Malcolm Brown (415 yards)\nMiami Dolphins - Myles Gaskin (864 yards) and Kalen Ballage (427 yards)\nMinnesota Vikings - Dalvin Cook (1,135 yards) and Alexander Mattison (271 yards)\nNew England Patriots - Sony Michel (844 yards) and Rex Burkhead (333 yards)\nNew Orleans Saints - Alvin Kamara (939 yards) and Latavius Murray (464 yards)\nNew York Giants - Saquon Barkley (1,003 yards) and Wayne Gallman (407 yards)\nNew York Jets - Le’Veon Bell (777 yards) and Frank Gore (444 yards)\nOakland Raiders - Josh Jacobs (1,065 yards) and DeAndré Washington (297 yards)\nPhiladelphia Eagles - Miles Sanders (866 yards) and Boston Scott (344 yards)\nPittsburgh Steelers - James Conner (1,059 yards) and Benny Sapp (244 yards)\nSan Francisco 49ers - Tevin Coleman (834 yards) and Matt Breida (425 yards)\nSeattle Seahawks - Chris Carson (1,230 yards) and Rashaad Penny (419 yards)\nTampa Bay Buccaneers - Peyton Barber (871 yards) and Ronald Jones II (322 yards)\nTennessee Titans - Derrick Henry (1,059 yards) and Dion Lewis (427 yards)\nWashington Redskins - Adrian Peterson (1,042 yards) and Derrius Guice (425 yards)\n\nReceivers:\n\nArizona Cardinals - Larry Fitzger\n\n\nThese results are closer to the wanted outcome, but still contain many flaws. Both sets don’t have the correct year, but I will ignore that for now since it doesn’t matter for the specific goal of making a correct codable hierarchy. The first one by chat GPT correctly lists the desired information in the way I hoped for. Each leader is listed, and is listed under their team. The LLama answer is incorrect because it gives the top two for each stat, and then runs out of room for the receiver section. I like the Chat GPT answer, and will now move on to making this a parsed list.\n\n\n\n\n\nChat GPT prompted: an you give me the code required as to parse this list into sections so it can be put into a markdown python note book. I would like there to be the general list with a heading for each team, and subheadings for rushing leaders and passing leaders.\n\n\n\n # List of each individual NFL team's leading rusher and receiver for the 2020 NFL season\nteam_data = {\n    'Arizona Cardinals': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Kenyan Drake',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'DeAndre Hopkins'\n    },\n    'Atlanta Falcons': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Todd Gurley',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Calvin Ridley'\n    },\n    # Add data for the rest of the teams here...\n}\n\n# Generate markdown content\nmarkdown_content = ''\nfor team, leaders in team_data.items():\n    markdown_content += f'## {team}\\n'\n    markdown_content += f'### Rushing Leader: {leaders[\"Rushing Leader\"]}\\n'\n    markdown_content += f'### Receiving Leader: {leaders[\"Receiving Leader\"]}\\n\\n'\n\n# Print markdown content\nprint(markdown_content)\n\n## Arizona Cardinals\n### Rushing Leader: Kenyan Drake\n### Receiving Leader: DeAndre Hopkins\n\n## Atlanta Falcons\n### Rushing Leader: Todd Gurley\n### Receiving Leader: Calvin Ridley\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is obviously flawed and incomplete, but serves as a good starting point for finalizing my intended results.

Let me know if you need any more information. * Llama Sure, here is a list of each individual NFL team’s leading rusher and receiver for the 2020 NFL season, based on the official NFL statistics:\nRushers:\n\nArizona Cardinals - Kenyan Drake (1059 yards) and David Johnson (812 yards)\nAtlanta Falcons - Devonta Freeman (833 yards) and Tevin Coleman (725 yards)\nBaltimore Ravens - Mark Ingram (1,018 yards) and Gus Edwards (723 yards)\nBuffalo Bills - Devin Singletary (977 yards) and Frank Gore (721 yards)\nCarolina Panthers - Christian McCaffrey (1,387 yards) and Cameron Artis-Payne (515 yards)\nChicago Bears - David Montgomery (1,059 yards) and Tarik Cohen (444 yards)\nCincinnati Bengals - Joe Mixon (1,137 yards) and Giovani Bernard (432 yards)\nCleveland Browns - Nick Chubb (865 yards) and Kareem Hunt (467 yards)\nDallas Cowboys - Ezekiel Elliott (979 yards) and Tony Pollard (275 yards)\nDenver Broncos - Melvin Gordon (841 yards) and Phillip Lindsay (704 yards)\nDetroit Lions - Kerryon Johnson (842 yards) and Ty Johnson (445 yards)\nGreen Bay Packers - Aaron Jones (1,084 yards) and Jamaal Williams (464 yards)\nHouston Texans - Carlos Hyde (1,070 yards) and Duke Johnson (427 yards)\nIndianapolis Colts - Jonathan Williams (833 yards) and Nyheim Hines (444 yards)\nJacksonville Jaguars - Leonard Fournette (815 yards) and Chris Thompson (367 yards)\nKansas City Chiefs - Darrel Williams (755 yards) and LeSean McCoy (435 yards)\nLos Angeles Chargers - Austin Ekeler (847 yards) and Melvin Gordon (476 yards)\nLos Angeles Rams - Todd Gurley (857 yards) and Malcolm Brown (415 yards)\nMiami Dolphins - Myles Gaskin (864 yards) and Kalen Ballage (427 yards)\nMinnesota Vikings - Dalvin Cook (1,135 yards) and Alexander Mattison (271 yards)\nNew England Patriots - Sony Michel (844 yards) and Rex Burkhead (333 yards)\nNew Orleans Saints - Alvin Kamara (939 yards) and Latavius Murray (464 yards)\nNew York Giants - Saquon Barkley (1,003 yards) and Wayne Gallman (407 yards)\nNew York Jets - Le’Veon Bell (777 yards) and Frank Gore (444 yards)\nOakland Raiders - Josh Jacobs (1,065 yards) and DeAndré Washington (297 yards)\nPhiladelphia Eagles - Miles Sanders (866 yards) and Boston Scott (344 yards)\nPittsburgh Steelers - James Conner (1,059 yards) and Benny Sapp (244 yards)\nSan Francisco 49ers - Tevin Coleman (834 yards) and Matt Breida (425 yards)\nSeattle Seahawks - Chris Carson (1,230 yards) and Rashaad Penny (419 yards)\nTampa Bay Buccaneers - Peyton Barber (871 yards) and Ronald Jones II (322 yards)\nTennessee Titans - Derrick Henry (1,059 yards) and Dion Lewis (427 yards)\nWashington Redskins - Adrian Peterson (1,042 yards) and Derrius Guice (425 yards)\n\nReceivers:\n\nArizona Cardinals - Larry Fitzger\n\n\nThese results are closer to the wanted outcome, but still contain many flaws. Both sets don’t have the correct year, but I will ignore that for now since it doesn’t matter for the specific goal of making a correct codable hierarchy. The first one by chat GPT correctly lists the desired information in the way I hoped for. Each leader is listed, and is listed under their team. The LLama answer is incorrect because it gives the top two for each stat, and then runs out of room for the receiver section. I like the Chat GPT answer, and will now move on to making this a parsed list.\n\n\n\n\n\nChat GPT prompted: an you give me the code required as to parse this list into sections so it can be put into a markdown python note book. I would like there to be the general list with a heading for each team, and subheadings for rushing leaders and passing leaders.\n\n\n\n # List of each individual NFL team's leading rusher and receiver for the 2020 NFL season\nteam_data = {\n    'Arizona Cardinals': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Kenyan Drake',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'DeAndre Hopkins'\n    },\n    'Atlanta Falcons': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Todd Gurley',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Calvin Ridley'\n    },\n    # Add data for the rest of the teams here...\n}\n\n# Generate markdown content\nmarkdown_content = ''\nfor team, leaders in team_data.items():\n    markdown_content += f'## {team}\\n'\n    markdown_content += f'### Rushing Leader: {leaders[\"Rushing Leader\"]}\\n'\n    markdown_content += f'### Receiving Leader: {leaders[\"Receiving Leader\"]}\\n\\n'\n\n# Print markdown content\nprint(markdown_content)\n\n## Arizona Cardinals\n### Rushing Leader: Kenyan Drake\n### Receiving Leader: DeAndre Hopkins\n\n## Atlanta Falcons\n### Rushing Leader: Todd Gurley\n### Receiving Leader: Calvin Ridley\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data is obviously flawed and incomplete, but serves as a good starting point for finalizing my intended results. With more prodding, I was able to get Chat GPT 3.5 to give the full code as to create the intended marked down list I wanted for my information.\n\n\n# List of each individual NFL team's leading rusher and receiver for the 2020 NFL season\nteam_data = {\n    'Arizona Cardinals': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Kenyan Drake',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'DeAndre Hopkins'\n    },\n    'Atlanta Falcons': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Todd Gurley',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Calvin Ridley'\n    },\n    'Baltimore Ravens': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Lamar Jackson',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Marquise Brown'\n    },\n    'Buffalo Bills': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Devin Singletary',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Stefon Diggs'\n    },\n    'Carolina Panthers': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Mike Davis',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Robby Anderson'\n    },\n    'Chicago Bears': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'David Montgomery',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Allen Robinson'\n    },\n    'Cincinnati Bengals': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Joe Mixon',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Tyler Boyd'\n    },\n    'Cleveland Browns': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Nick Chubb',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Jarvis Landry'\n    },\n    'Dallas Cowboys': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Ezekiel Elliott',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Amari Cooper'\n    },\n    'Denver Broncos': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Melvin Gordon',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Jerry Jeudy'\n    },\n    'Detroit Lions': {\n        'Rushing Leader': \"D'Andre Swift\",\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Marvin Jones'\n    },\n    'Green Bay Packers': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Aaron Jones',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Davante Adams'\n    },\n    'Houston Texans': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'David Johnson',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'Brandin Cooks'\n    },\n    'Indianapolis Colts': {\n        'Rushing Leader': 'Jonathan Taylor',\n        'Receiving Leader': 'T.Y.
