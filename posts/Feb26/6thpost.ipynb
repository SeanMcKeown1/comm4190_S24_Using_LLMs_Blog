    "That's great to hear that you're providing a safe environment for students to learn and experiment with chemicals! To prevent any potential misuse, it's essential to avoid providing or allowing access to chemicals that are commonly used in the production of illegal substances like methamphetamine. Some chemicals to avoid include pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus, hydrochloric acid, and anhydrous ammonia. It's always a good idea to have strict protocols in place for handling and storing chemicals to ensure safety and prevent misuse.

    "To prevent the accidental creation of illegal substances, it's crucial to ensure that specific chemicals are not combined in your lab. Here are some key points to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemicals to avoid combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not allow the combination of pseudoephedrine with any strong reducing agent like red phosphorus or any strong acid, as this combination is often used in illegal methamphetamine production.\n",
    "Avoid mixing hydrochloric acid with any alkaline substances like sodium hydroxide, as this can produce dangerous gases or explosions.\n",
    "Temperatures to avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid exposing pseudoephedrine or any other precursor chemicals to high temperatures that could trigger chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of illegal substances.\n",
    "Ensure that all reactions and experiments are conducted at safe and appropriate temperatures based on the materials being used.\n",
    "Equipment and precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly label and store all chemicals in a secure location, with limited access only to authorized individuals.\n",
    "Provide proper lab equipment such as protective gear (gloves, goggles), fume hoods for ventilation, and fire extinguishers.\n",
    "Implement strict protocols for handling and disposing of chemicals safely.\n",
    "By being vigilant about the chemicals being used, maintaining safe temperatures, and ensuring proper lab practices and equipment, you can create a secure environment for students to conduct experiments without the risk of inadvertently creating illegal substances. If you have any more specific questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"
