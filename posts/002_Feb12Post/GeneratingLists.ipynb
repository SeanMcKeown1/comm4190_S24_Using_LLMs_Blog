    "> These results are closer to the wanted outcome, but still contain many flaws. Both sets don't have the correct year, but I will ignore that for now since it doesn't matter for the specific goal of making a correct codable hierarchy. The first one by chat GPT correctly lists the desired information in the way I hoped for. Each leader is listed, and is listed under their team. The LLama answer is incorrect because it gives the top two for each stat, and then runs out of room for the receiver section. I like the Chat GPT answer, and will now move on to making this a parsed list."
